Current functionality:
get_uoy_term_info($epoch) -- returns array containing week number (0 if not term), term number (0 if not term), year number (academic start year), term name (including breaks), year name (YYYY-YYYY format)

the function will look at the cache for the data, if not availabile the cache will update from trusted sources.

TODO: add functions to add trusted sources, add functions to add data to xml file. At the moment these are done manually. 

A few variable are used to determine the cache location:
$file -- the name of the file as visible by both local file directory and webserver
$url -- domain and path of the file without http:// or trailing slash
$localdir -- local file directory location
